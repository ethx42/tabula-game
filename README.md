# 🎴 Lotería Board Generator

A modern, enterprise-grade web application for generating **optimally distributed** Lotería game boards using advanced mathematical optimization algorithms.

## 🌟 What is Lotería?

[Lotería](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loter%C3%ADa) is a traditional Mexican game of chance, similar to bingo. Players mark images on their boards as a caller announces cards. The challenge? **Creating fair, diverse boards** where no two players have nearly identical cards.

This application solves that problem using **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** to generate boards with mathematically optimal distribution.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Smart Board Generation
- **Wizard-style interface** — Step-by-step configuration for items, board size, and quantity
- **Real-time validation** — Instant feedback on configuration constraints
- **Intelligent suggestions** — When a configuration is invalid, the system tells you exactly how to fix it

### 🧮 Mathematical Optimization
- **HiGHS ILP Solver** — Industrial-strength optimization engine (same solver used by Google OR-Tools)
- **Overlap minimization** — Boards are generated to be as different as possible
- **Fisher-Yates shuffle** — Items are randomly distributed within each board for visual variety

### 🔐 Reproducibility
- **Optional seed** — Generate the same boards every time with a custom seed
- **Deterministic output** — Same configuration + same seed = identical results

### 📊 Export Options
- **JSON** — For integration with other systems
- **CSV** — For spreadsheets and printing
- **Print-ready** — Optimized layout for physical boards

## 📖 How It Works

### The Problem

Imagine you need 50 game boards, each with 16 items selected from a pool of 36. How do you ensure:
1. Every board is **unique**?
2. No two boards are **too similar**?
3. All items appear with **fair frequency**?

Manually creating these boards is tedious and error-prone. Random generation often produces duplicates or highly similar boards.

### The Solution

This application uses **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** to model board generation as an optimization problem:

```
Minimize: Maximum overlap between any two boards
Subject to:
  - Each board has exactly S items
  - Each item appears with its target frequency
  - No board contains duplicate items
  - All boards are unique
```

The HiGHS solver finds the optimal solution in seconds.

## 🔬 Mathematical Constraints

The generator enforces these constraints in real-time:

| Constraint | Formula | Plain English |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Slot Balance** | `∑fᵢ = B × S` | Total item appearances = boards × items per board |
| **Minimum Items** | `N ≥ S` | You need at least as many items as board slots |
| **Minimum Frequency** | `fᵢ ≥ 1` | Every item appears at least once |
| **Maximum Frequency** | `fᵢ ≤ B` | No item appears more than once per board |
| **Feasibility** | `N ≤ T ≤ N×B` | Total slots are within mathematical bounds |
| **Uniqueness** | `C(N,S) ≥ B` | Enough combinations exist for unique boards |
| **Overlap Quality** | `S/N ≤ 50%` | Boards don't use too much of the item pool |

### Smart Error Messages

When a configuration is invalid, you get actionable suggestions:

```
❌ Only 1 possible unique boards, need 100. 
   Try: add 2 more items (18 total), 
        or use smaller boards (3×5 = 14 slots), 
        or reduce to 1 boards.
```
